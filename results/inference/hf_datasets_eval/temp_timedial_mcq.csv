A: I understand . I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home .
B: Let me just check that on my computer . Oakfield is a low risk area , so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month . The other thing to take into account is deductibles .
A: In this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000 . what does that mean exactly ?

A: Oh , I see . That ' s fine . What is the advantage of having higher deductibles ?
B: If you have higher deductibles , your premium are lower , because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less .

A: well , it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend end quickly too .
B: I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married .
A: oh , that's too short-lived .
B: that's true . It's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s generation .
A: I can't agree more . The only-child generation in China tends to know little about marriage .
B: definitely . They don't take relationships and marriages very seriously .
A: in their mind , love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone .
B: I think , as the saying goes as the saying goes haste makes waste , it is the same thing with marriage .

base_lm-alpaca-merged,"A:In 1986 , a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment . This sport is very challenging . It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance . Especially when descending , as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back , they sway around . The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it . Even if they jump off , they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes . No wonder people give the title ' brave ' to anyone who jumps off .
B: You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth . The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord .
A: Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage .
B: A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , "" When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more . If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to ' bakemeat ' . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was <MASK> . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds .

Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ?

B: Do we get a day off from school then ?
A: No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is .
B: Www , man !
A: In <MASK> , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ' s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .
B: Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?
A: Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .
B: And then what happened ?
A: Well , as we say , the rest is history ...

A: No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is .
B: Www , man !
A: In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by <MASK> , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ' s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .
B: Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?
A: Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .
B: And then what happened ?

B: Oh , my God ! John , I didn ' t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory .
A: Come on , Han Maimed , don ' t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion .
B: But I ' m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ?
A: Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world .
B: I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ' t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ?
A: That ' s a little complicated . You ' ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ' s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion .
B: Really ?
A: Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England .
B: Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ?
A: Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans .
B: How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ?
A: That ' s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries .
B: So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ?
A: Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College .
B: Why did they want to found a college ?
A: Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well .
B: Oh , I see .
A: Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name .
B: When did it begin to be called Harvard University ?
A: In <MASK> , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman .
B: It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion .
A: Therefore , it ' s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard .
B: Wow , I didn ' t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history .
A: Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S .
B: I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard .
A: Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related .

A: In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , <MASK> a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement .

B: Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?
A: Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .
B: And then what happened ?

base_lm-alpaca-merged,"A:Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background .
B: I have been working as a paralegal for <MASK> through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used .
A: What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ?
B: Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input .
A: Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ?
B: There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort .
A: Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome .
B: I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done .
A: What are your strengths and weaknesses ?
B: My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more .
A: Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss .
B: I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day .
A: When do you find a job satisfying ?
B: My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner .
A: How would your coworkers describe you ?
B: First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first . And thirdly , they'll say that I know the law . I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously .
A: Do you have any questions ?
B: Yes , I do . On a scale of one to 10 , what would you say morale was in this company ?

Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ?

B: Do we get a day off from school then ?
A: No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is .
B: Www , man !
A: In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ' s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .
B: Cool ! Is that why we only work <MASK> now ?
A: Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .

The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it . Even if they jump off , they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes .

B: A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , "" When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous .

When rebounding to the high altitude , I felt a sudden sense of relief . I did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable . ""

A: It ' s always easier to say something than to do it .

This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications .
A: But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans .

A: It ' s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes .

Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement .

base_lm-alpaca-merged,"A:Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background .
B: I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used .
A: What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ?
B: Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input .
A: Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ?
B: There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort .
A: Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome .
B: I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done .
A: What are your strengths and weaknesses ?
B: My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more .
A: Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss .
B: I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her <MASK> , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day .
A: When do you find a job satisfying ?
B: My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner .
A: How would your coworkers describe you ?
B: First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first . And thirdly , they'll say that I know the law . I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously .
A: Do you have any questions ?
B: Yes , I do . On a scale of one to 10 , what would you say morale was in this company ?

base_lm-alpaca-merged,"A:In 1986 , a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment . This sport is very challenging . It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance . Especially when descending , as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back , they sway around . The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it . Even if they jump off , they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes . No wonder people give the title ' brave ' to anyone who jumps off .
B: You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth .

It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ?
B: Cinct de mayo ?

B: Do we get a day off from school then ?

B: Www , man !
A: In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the <MASK> work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ' s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .
B: Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?
A: Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .
B: And then what happened ?

A: Oh , I see . That ' s fine . What is the advantage of having higher deductibles ?
B: If you have higher deductibles , your premium are lower , because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less .

temp_tag-alpaca-merged,"A:In 1986 , a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment . This sport is very challenging . It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance . Especially when descending , as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back , they sway around . The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it . Even if they jump off , they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes . No wonder people give the title ' brave ' to anyone who jumps off .
B: You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth .

A: Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage .
B: A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , "" When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more . If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to ' bakemeat ' . However , I knew my worries were unwanted .

A: No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is .

A: In <MASK> , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ' s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .
B: Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?
A: Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .
B: And then what happened ?

temp_tag-alpaca-merged,"A:Alright everyone settle down . Let ' s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ?

B: Do we get a day off from school then ?
A: No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is .
B: Www , man !
A: In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by <MASK> , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ' s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .
B: Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?
A: Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .
B: And then what happened ?
A: Well , as we say , the rest is history ...

B: Oh , my God ! John , I didn ' t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory .
A: Come on , Han Maimed , don ' t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion .
B: But I ' m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ?
A: Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world .
B: I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ' t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ?
A: That ' s a little complicated . You ' ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ' s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion .
B: Really ?
A: Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England .
B: Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ?
A: Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans .
B: How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ?
A: That ' s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries .
B: So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ?
A: Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College .
B: Why did they want to found a college ?
A: Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well .
B: Oh , I see .
A: Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name .
B: When did it begin to be called Harvard University ?
A: In <MASK> , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman .
B: It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion .
A: Therefore , it ' s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard .
B: Wow , I didn ' t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history .
A: Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S .
B: I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard .
A: Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related .
B: That ' s right . I have a lot to learn from you .

A: In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , <MASK> a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ' s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .
B: Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?
A: Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .
B: And then what happened ?

A: You certainly drive a hard bargain , Mrs . Brown .
B: On the contrary , Mr . London , we value your friendship more than anything else . We both understand our slippers are very popular in your market on account of their superior quality and compete - time price . And with the sole agency in your hand , there will be no competition and you can easily control the market , which would naturally result in bigger sales . I'm sure you can fulfill the agreement without much difficulty .

temp_tag-alpaca-merged,"A:Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background .
B: I have been working as a paralegal for <MASK> through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used .
A: What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ?
B: Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input .
A: Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ?
B: There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort .
A: Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome .
B: I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done .
A: What are your strengths and weaknesses ?
B: My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more .
A: Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss .
B: I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day .
A: When do you find a job satisfying ?
B: My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner .
A: How would your coworkers describe you ?
B: First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first . And thirdly , they'll say that I know the law . I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously .
A: Do you have any questions ?
B: Yes , I do . On a scale of one to 10 , what would you say morale was in this company ?

B: Do we get a day off from school then ?
A: No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is .
B: Www , man !
A: In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ' s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .
B: Cool ! Is that why we only work <MASK> now ?
A: Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .

But she was open to suggestions , so long as employees could back them up with research and facts . When I submitted my suggestion , she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work . She then took my revised proposal to her boss . He was a more conservative type , but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks . He did , and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change .

The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it . Even if they jump off , they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes .

temp_tag-alpaca-merged,"A:Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ?
B: Sure . First of all , it ' s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ' t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic .
A: Yeah , that's very important .
B: So you ' d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment .
A: I ' ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer .
B: That ' s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually <MASK> .
A: It ' s always easier to say something than to do it .
B: It ' s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications .
A: But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans .
B: I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes .
A: It ' s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes .
B: You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous .
A: I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time .
B: You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement .
A: It seems that ' clothes make the man ' .
B: It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior .

I propose a sole agency agreement for Ladies and gents plastic slippers ( excluding children's ) for a duration of <MASK> ; 60,000 pairs to be sold in the first year , 70,000 pairs in the second year , and 80,000 pairs in the third year , the area is to be within the continent of Australia ( excluding any neighboring island ) , commission 5 % .
A: You certainly drive a hard bargain , Mrs . Brown .
B: On the contrary , Mr . London , we value your friendship more than anything else . We both understand our slippers are very popular in your market on account of their superior quality and compete - time price . And with the sole agency in your hand , there will be no competition and you can easily control the market , which would naturally result in bigger sales . I'm sure you can fulfill the agreement without much difficulty .
A: Well , if you put it this way , I'll have to comply . When shall we sign the contract , Mrs . Brown ?
B: Tomorrow afternoon .
A: Tomorrow afternoon will be fine .

A: How about your other siblings ? Do they spend a lot of time with your parents ?
B: Two of my sisters still live at home , even though they have already graduated from university and have good jobs . They enjoy spending their free time with my parents . I guess in that respect , I'm the black sheep of the family .
A: I see . Do your parents ever ask you to come home to visit them more often ?
B: They're always asking me to come home , but I think our relationship is better if we keep a distance from each other . Whenever we see each other , all we do is fight .

temp_tag-alpaca-merged,"A:Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background .
B: I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used .
A: What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ?
B: Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input .
A: Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ?
B: There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort .
A: Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome .
B: I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done .
A: What are your strengths and weaknesses ?
B: My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more .
A: Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss .
B: I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her <MASK> , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day .
A: When do you find a job satisfying ?
B: My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner .
A: How would your coworkers describe you ?
B: First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first . And thirdly , they'll say that I know the law . I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously .
A: Do you have any questions ?
B: Yes , I do . On a scale of one to 10 , what would you say morale was in this company ?

temp_tag-alpaca-merged,"A:In 1986 , a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment . This sport is very challenging . It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance . Especially when descending , as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back , they sway around . The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it . Even if they jump off , they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes . No wonder people give the title ' brave ' to anyone who jumps off .
B: You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth . The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord .
A: Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage .

A: In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the <MASK> work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ' s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .
B: Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?
A: Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .
B: And then what happened ?

B: If you have higher deductibles , your premium are lower , because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less .

temp_cat-alpaca-merged,"A:In 1986 , a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment . This sport is very challenging . It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance . Especially when descending , as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back , they sway around . The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it . Even if they jump off , they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes . No wonder people give the title ' brave ' to anyone who jumps off .
B: You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth . The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord .
A: Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage .
B: A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , "" When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more . If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to ' bakemeat ' . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was <MASK> . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds .

B: Do we get a day off from school then ?
A: No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is .
B: Www , man !
A: In <MASK> , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ' s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .
B: Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?
A: Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .
B: And then what happened ?

temp_cat-alpaca-merged,"A:Alright everyone settle down . Let ' s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ?
B: Cinct de mayo ?

B: Do we get a day off from school then ?
A: No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is .
B: Www , man !
A: In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by <MASK> , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ' s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .
B: Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?
A: Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .
B: And then what happened ?
A: Well , as we say , the rest is history ...

B: Oh , my God ! John , I didn ' t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory .

A: That ' s a little complicated . You ' ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ' s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion .
B: Really ?
A: Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England .
B: Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ?
A: Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans .
B: How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ?
A: That ' s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries .
B: So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ?
A: Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College .
B: Why did they want to found a college ?
A: Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well .
B: Oh , I see .
A: Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name .
B: When did it begin to be called Harvard University ?
A: In <MASK> , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman .
B: It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion .
A: Therefore , it ' s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard .
B: Wow , I didn ' t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history .
A: Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S .
B: I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard .
A: Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related .

A: In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , <MASK> a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ' s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .
B: Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?
A: Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .
B: And then what happened ?

As you know , I am experienced in the business of slippers and enjoy a good business relationship with all the leading whole - sabers and retailers in that line .

A: You certainly drive a hard bargain , Mrs . Brown .
B: On the contrary , Mr . London , we value your friendship more than anything else . We both understand our slippers are very popular in your market on account of their superior quality and compete - time price . And with the sole agency in your hand , there will be no competition and you can easily control the market , which would naturally result in bigger sales . I'm sure you can fulfill the agreement without much difficulty .

temp_cat-alpaca-merged,"A:Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background .
B: I have been working as a paralegal for <MASK> through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used .
A: What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ?
B: Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input .
A: Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ?
B: There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort .
A: Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome .
B: I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done .
A: What are your strengths and weaknesses ?
B: My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more .
A: Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss .
B: I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day .
A: When do you find a job satisfying ?
B: My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner .
A: How would your coworkers describe you ?
B: First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first . And thirdly , they'll say that I know the law . I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously .
A: Do you have any questions ?
B: Yes , I do . On a scale of one to 10 , what would you say morale was in this company ?

A: No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is .
B: Www , man !
A: In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ' s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .
B: Cool ! Is that why we only work <MASK> now ?
A: Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .

temp_cat-alpaca-merged,"A:What's your ideal boss ?
B: I have had an incredible boss , who was my direct supervisor during the last year of my coop work experience . A-bout <MASK> after I began working for her , she really let me spread my wings . She encouraged me to work independently , because she said she had come to trust my judgment and commitment . So I was able to move forward on projects without having to check in with her every day . Of course , I made certain that she knew what I had accomplished on a daily and weekly basis because I gave her summary reports , although she didn't specifically ask me to . Without her support and encouragement , I don't think I would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time . But she was open to suggestions , so long as employees could back them up with research and facts . When I submitted my suggestion , she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work . She then took my revised proposal to her boss . He was a more conservative type , but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks . He did , and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change . I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs . And while I'd certainly prefer to work for one like I've just described , I'm the kind of person who can get along with just about anyone .

The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it . Even if they jump off , they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes .

B: A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , "" When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous .

temp_cat-alpaca-merged,"A:Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ?
B: Sure . First of all , it ' s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ' t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic .
A: Yeah , that's very important .
B: So you ' d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment .
A: I ' ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer .
B: That ' s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually <MASK> .
A: It ' s always easier to say something than to do it .
B: It ' s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications .
A: But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans .
B: I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes .
A: It ' s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes .
B: You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous .
A: I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time .
B: You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement .
A: It seems that ' clothes make the man ' .
B: It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior .

B: We've been looking forward to your visit . It is a great pleasure for us to have you as our guest . It is always more convenient to discuss things face to face .
A: I would like to tell you that my clients are very satisfied with the last delivery of your slippers . The styles and colors are very much to the taste of our market .
B: We've received some similar comments from other Australian firms too .
A: I understand you are selling the same products to some other Australian importers . This tends to complicate my business . As you know , I am experienced in the business of slippers and enjoy a good business relationship with all the leading whole - sabers and retailers in that line . I have a mind to expand this business in the years to come . One of the reasons of my visit here is to sign a sole agency agreement with you on these items for a period of 3 years . As it is to our mutual interests and profit , I am sure you'll have no objection to it .
B: We appreciate your good intention and your effort in pushing the sale of our slippers . As you know , the demand for this item in your market is quite substantial .

I propose a sole agency agreement for Ladies and gents plastic slippers ( excluding children's ) for a duration of <MASK> ; 60,000 pairs to be sold in the first year , 70,000 pairs in the second year , and 80,000 pairs in the third year , the area is to be within the continent of Australia ( excluding any neighboring island ) , commission 5 % .
A: You certainly drive a hard bargain , Mrs . Brown .
B: On the contrary , Mr . London , we value your friendship more than anything else . We both understand our slippers are very popular in your market on account of their superior quality and compete - time price . And with the sole agency in your hand , there will be no competition and you can easily control the market , which would naturally result in bigger sales . I'm sure you can fulfill the agreement without much difficulty .
A: Well , if you put it this way , I'll have to comply . When shall we sign the contract , Mrs . Brown ?
B: Tomorrow afternoon .
A: Tomorrow afternoon will be fine .

Enjoy the speed on the road . Just think , you are flashing past the poles with your own energy . How great !

temp_cat-alpaca-merged,"A:Do you think chinese families have changed much in <MASK> ?
B: I think families everywhere have changed a lot in the last 5 decades .
A: What do you think is the biggest change ?
B: Well , in the past , three or four generations would live together under the same roof . Nowadays , living in the same city as one's relatives is becoming rare .
A: That's true . You know , some husbands and wives don't even live in the same city any more .
B: Would you consider having your parents live with you when they get older ?
A: I guess I'm a bit old-fashioned . I'd rather have my parents live with me than live in a retirement room .
B: That's very respectable , but I could never live with my parents . I usually only see them at our christmas celebration — and that's enough !
A: How about your other siblings ? Do they spend a lot of time with your parents ?
B: Two of my sisters still live at home , even though they have already graduated from university and have good jobs . They enjoy spending their free time with my parents . I guess in that respect , I'm the black sheep of the family .
A: I see . Do your parents ever ask you to come home to visit them more often ?
B: They're always asking me to come home , but I think our relationship is better if we keep a distance from each other . Whenever we see each other , all we do is fight .

temp_cat-alpaca-merged,"A:Alright everyone settle down . Let ' s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ?
B: Cinct de mayo ?
A: No , that ' s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ' Day .
B: Do we get a day off from school then ?
A: No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is .
B: Www , man !
A: In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that <MASK> would constitute a legal day ' s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .
B: Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?
A: Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .
B: And then what happened ?
A: Well , as we say , the rest is history ...

temp_cat-alpaca-merged,"A:Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background .
B: I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used .
A: What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ?
B: Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input .
A: Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ?
B: There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort .
A: Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome .
B: I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done .
A: What are your strengths and weaknesses ?
B: My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more .
A: Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss .
B: I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her <MASK> , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day .
A: When do you find a job satisfying ?
B: My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner .
A: How would your coworkers describe you ?
B: First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first . And thirdly , they'll say that I know the law . I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously .
A: Do you have any questions ?
B: Yes , I do . On a scale of one to 10 , what would you say morale was in this company ?

temp_cat-alpaca-merged,"A:In 1986 , a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment . This sport is very challenging . It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance . Especially when descending , as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back , they sway around . The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it . Even if they jump off , they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes . No wonder people give the title ' brave ' to anyone who jumps off .
B: You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth . The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord .
A: Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage .
B: A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , "" When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more . If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to ' bakemeat ' . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or <MASK> . When rebounding to the high altitude , I felt a sudden sense of relief . I did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable . ""
A: It is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of ' comfortable '

temp_cat-alpaca-merged,"A:So how did you meet Bill ?
B: I met him through a computer bulletin board .
A: Oh , really ? Which bulletin board ?
B: It was one I used down at the local coffee house called the San Francisco Net . It's been around since around <MASK> .
A: I've heard about that , but I've never tried it .
B: You ought to . One dollar buys you 15 minutes of computer time . A Chat session links you with cappuccino sippers in other cafes and also to home computers on the network .
A: I have no desire to talk on a network with a bunch of strangers .
B: That's the whole point . All your inhibitions disappear because you can ' t see the other person . This network allows you to talk to people whom you normally wouldn ' t talk to .
A: I just want a private conversation with one other person .
B: You can do that . A private session lets two people talk alone . This techno-chat program lets you talk about anything with everybody , without prejudice because you can ' t see them .
A: Well , maybe I'll tag along and watch how you talk .
B: That's fine with me , but we'll have to get there early . Because after 8 pm , there is always a long line .

B: So I can attend conferences and do business on that visa ?
